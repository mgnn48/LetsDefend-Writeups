# 👋 Welcome to My Blue Team Journal!

Hi there! I'm **Mehmet Talha Gönen**, an aspiring SOC Analyst based in the Netherlands.

After a disciplined career in the military, I decided to follow my true passion: **Technology & Cybersecurity.** This repository serves as my digital notebook and portfolio where I document my hands-on learning journey.

### 🎯 What is this repo about?
Here, you will find detailed **write-ups (walkthroughs)** of the security incidents I investigate on **LetsDefend**. Instead of just finding the "flag," I focus on the **"why" and "how"**:
* How did the attacker get in? (Root Cause Analysis)
* What traces did they leave? (Log Analysis)
* How can we stop them? (Incident Response)

### 🚀 Why am I doing this?
I believe the best way to learn is to get my hands dirty with real logs and alerts. I created this repo to:
1.  **Track my progress** as I transition into a cybersecurity career.
2.  **Share knowledge** with the community (especially for those stuck on similar challenges!).
3.  **Showcase my methodology** to potential teammates and mentors.

Feel free to explore my reports, suggest improvements, or just say hi! I'm always eager to learn something new.
